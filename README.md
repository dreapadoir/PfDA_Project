# Programming for Data Analysis ATU 22/23 - Project 1
# Author: David Higgins G00411302
This repository will contain a Jupyter notebook containing my submission for Project 1 of this module. I will synthesise a dataset that represents the survivability of mountaineers on Mt. Everest. I will begin my research using the Mt. Everest Ascent dataset generated by Roshan Pandey on Kaggle. The commercialisation of climbing Everest has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Growing crowds of inexperienced mountaineers on the mountain and an upsurge in attempts being made without oxygen have been blamed for increasing death rates in recent seasons. I will look at the subset of mountaineers who successfully summitted and examine what variables impact on their survival.

One of the initial tasks was to consider if all the data contained in Pandey's dataset was relevant to my model. My synthetic dataset would represent a typical year on Everest in the very near future. As such, the majority of climbers would be on commercial expeditions supported by Sherpa and Western guides. This type of climbing really began on Everest in 1985 when an American businessman, Dick Bass, was guided to the summit by David Breashears as part of his attempt to climb the Seven Summits, the highest peaks on each continent. I am only going to consider the data from 1985 onwards to get a better approximation of the behaviour of clients on commerical expeditions. Prior to this, mountaineers attempting Everest would be professional climbers and generally members of national or sponsored expeditions. The dataframe, df, is set to include only the rows of data for 1985 onwards.

One of the first aspects of the synthetic dataset I generate is the number of summitters for that particular year, N. By using the unique() method on the Year column, I was able to create an array with the list of years. Then using the groupby method with Year as the argument on the dataframe df, I counted the number of summitters for each year from 1985 to 2020. I used these two arrays to train a linear regression model which then predicted the number of climbers in 2023.
