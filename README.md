# Programming for Data Analysis ATU 22/23 - Project 1
# Author: David Higgins G00411302
This repository will contain a Jupyter notebook containing my submission for Project 1 of this module. I will synthesise a dataset that represents the survivability of mountaineers on Mt. Everest. I will begin my research using the Mt. Everest Ascent dataset generated by Roshan Pandey on Kaggle. The commercialisation of climbing Everest has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Growing crowds of inexperienced mountaineers on the mountain and an upsurge in attempts being made without oxygen have been blamed for increasing death rates in recent seasons. I will look at the subset of mountaineers who successfully summitted and examine what variables impact on their survival.
